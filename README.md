# Skin-Cancer-detection-model
This project demonstrates the viability of knowledge distillation in developing lightweight skin cancer detection models. While accuracy trade-offs exist, the student modelâ€™s efficiency enables real-world deployment. Future work will focus on improving minority class performance and expanding clinical validation.
